# 2D Self Driving Car Simulator

This is a 2D self driving car simulation powered by machine learning/neural nets. It's built in JavaScript with no major dependencies.
Built by Andrew Mitchell based on the tutorial at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI).

## Future possible additions

- Implement roads that curve and follow other non straight shapes.
- Make standard AI traffic random, with varying speeds and new vehicles being added the further you get.
- Implement option of using crossover rather than mutation.
- Implement GUI for messing with ML params (such as mutation rate).
- Implement automated saving of best car and auto advancing to the next generation.
